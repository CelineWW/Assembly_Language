W11 Procedures
Generate English uppercase characters from A to Z. After every character, there must be a line feed. Use procedures and loops to optimize the code. Do not use gdb debugger. The executable file will run directly on the terminal. 

section .text
        global _start

_start:
        mov ecx,26
        mov eax,65  ;initialize eax to ASCII=65 'A'

label:
        push ecx    ;ecx = 26 is saved in the stack
        mov [temp],eax  
        mov ecx,temp
        push eax    ;eax = 65 is saved in the stack
        call output
        mov eax,10
        mov [temp],eax
        mov ecx,temp
        call output
        pop eax	    ;eax is removed from the stack and saved in the eax
        pop ecx     ;ecx is removed from the stack and saved in the ecx
        inc eax	    ;increment eax to be next ASCII code
        loop label

output:
        mov eax,4
        mov ebx,1
        mov edx,1
        int 0x80
        ret

        mov eax,1
        int 0x80
 
segment .bss
        temp resb 1


Challenges: 
	1.I have being struggled with getting a segmentation fault error.
	2.ecx is used to be a counter and message printout. eax used for storing data value and also as system write. So ecx/eax-push/pop is a must to save to stack.
	2.print out message must use a pointer, not the value itself.
